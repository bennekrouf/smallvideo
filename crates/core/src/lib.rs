//! Project model: what was recorded and how it should look. No capture, no GPU, no UI here,
//! so every decision about the picture is a pure function that tests can pin down.
//!
//! Coordinates are normalized to the captured display: (0, 0) is its top-left corner and
//! (1, 1) its bottom-right, whatever its resolution. Times are seconds from the take's start.
